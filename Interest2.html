        <h2 class="b" >Ethical Hacking</h2>
        <p style="font-size: medium; font-family:Lucida Sans; margin:18px 95px;">
            Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an 
            ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers.
            A white hat (or a white hat hacker) is an ethical<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker" > security hacker</a>.[1] Ethical hacking is
             a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing.
             Contrasted with the black hat, a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally 
             wear a white and a black hat, respectively.
             There is a third kind of hacker known as a grey hat who hacks with good intentions but at times without permission
